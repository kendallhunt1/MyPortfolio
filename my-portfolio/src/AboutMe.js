            <p className="aboutMeHeadline">Father, Husband, Avid Learner, and Aggressive Habit Builder. My tough young years cemented who I've become, and aspire to be.
               I've chosen technology, specifically software development because of out-of-the-box thinking it requires, creative solutions that are created, 
               the problems it can solve, and the opportunities it will provide for myself, and the rest of the world.
               I've worked in many different atmospheres, and heavily with teams that require strong individual performance to reach collective goals –– Which is the atmosphere I love to be in.
               My greatest accomplishment, and opportunity is getting to help mold my daughter into a strong woman who, I hope, pursues all that she loves.
               I love a lot of things, and a few of those things are golfing, gaming, developing, weight training, and building habits.
